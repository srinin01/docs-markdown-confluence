# ðŸ“˜ Obsidian Development

To work on Obsidian development, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm run dev-obsidian`. This command builds and watches code, pushing it into the `dev-vault` part of the repo.
2. Make sure you've set the appropriate settings, as they're excluded from the repo.
3. Use the `dev-vault` in Obsidian to test out the plugin. The `hot-reload` plugin is installed to automatically reload the plugin right after you save the code.
4. Sometimes Obsidian might act up, and you'll need to restart it.
5. Most importantly, have fun! ðŸŽ‰
