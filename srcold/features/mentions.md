# 🚀 Mentions Support: It's Time to Have Fun with Mentions! 🎉

Hello there, fellow adventurer! Are you ready to embark on a thrilling journey to bring your Markdown Confluence skills to the next level? Do you want to engage your teammates and colleagues in a fun and interactive way? Say no more, as you've just arrived at the perfect destination! 🌟

Introducing **Mentions Support** in Markdown-Confluence! A feature that allows you to mention your teammates with flair and pizzazz. It's super easy and fun to use. Let's get started!

## 🎩 The Magic Mention Formula

To conjure up a mention, you just need to type the following magical incantation:

```
[[mentions:{userid}|@{Users Name}]]
```

This magical spell transforms into a marvelous Atlassian Document Format Mention node. You can learn more about the enchanting world of nodes [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/nodes/mention/).

## 🔍 Seeking the User ID Treasure

But wait! To complete the spell, you'll need the mystical _User ID_. Fear not, for we shall guide you on your quest!

1. Set sail to the land of **Teams** 🏴‍☠️
2. Unleash the power of the **Search** 🔍
3. Click on the desired user to reveal their secret URL 🗝️

For example, if the search URL is:
```
https://markdown-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/people/search
```

And you discover the user's URL to be:
```
https://markdown-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:aea5688c-52b9-4d15-aabe-96def1abc413
```

Eureka! You've found the hidden treasure: the User ID! In this case:
```
557058:aea5688c-52b9-4d15-aabe-96def1abc413
```

## 🌈 Making Mention Magic Happen

Now that you've obtained the User ID, you can cast the magical mention spell!

For instance, if you want to mention `Captain Confluence` with their User ID, you'd simply type:
```
[[mentions:557058:aea5688c-52b9-4d15-aabe-96def1abc413|@Captain Confluence]]
```

And there you have it, brave adventurer! You've mastered the art of **Mentions Support** in Markdown-Confluence. Spread the joy and summon your teammates in a fun and captivating way, making your collaboration experience more delightful than ever! 🎊🎉
